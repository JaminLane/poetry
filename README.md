Jamin Lane Poetry Project 
For this poetry project I decided to select the poem "Fire and Ice" by Robert Frost. For a world that is going through such uncertain times i believed that this poem would be able to connect to the different thoughts on the end of the world. I decided to tie in the story of "The Myths of the Souix" by Marie L. McLaughlin. I decided on this story becuase it speaks of my Native American roots. When looking at the poem by Frost, which tell a story of an uncertain future, and the book by McLaughlin, which tells the story of my families rich history and past, I believe that I am able to make poety the shows myself. I was able to combine the future I will live through with the past my family went through to get poetry that will describe myself as I am. 

Below I have included my code for the project.
